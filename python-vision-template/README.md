# Vision Demo

Python demo for using the Spawner.AI API for vision applications. 

## Getting Started

If you need an API key you can get it from [Spawner](https://spawner.ai)

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using conda or virtualenv to sandbox your work

### Manual Install 
If you go the manual route instead of requirements we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
```
pip install requests
```

For additional information on Spawner API: [Docs](https://spawner.gitbook.io/spawner-docs/)

### Running python script
From command line navigate to your application's directory and use:
```
python client.py
```
